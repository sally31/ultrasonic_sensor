## Introduction


when you are at 10cm from this sensor it will start beeping, when you are at 5cm from this sensor it will beep high petch with beet. this is imaged that car sensor like when you revarse your car and when you close to the wall it will beep. if it too close to the wall it will beep louder but this sensor is not made it sound louder so I changed tone higher and plus beet that will warn you.
